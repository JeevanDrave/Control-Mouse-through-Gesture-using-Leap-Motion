You can control system mouse through specified gesture using Leap Motion device

Here what I have provide the program is to control system Mouse using Leap Motion Device
For more information related to Leap Motion Device visit https://www.leapmotion.com/ web site if you dont know about Leap Motion device

Firstly I will let you know how these program works:
1. Once you run the program it will get started into system tray of your system.
2. Connect your Leap Motion Device to system.
3. Then right click over the Icon and click Start and perform the gesture over device what I have specified below to control mouse.
4. If you do like to stop application then right click on icon and select Stop option then system will get exit. 

So the operation which we perform using mouse as:

1. Mouse Cursor Move

2. Mouse Left Button Click

3. Mouse Right Button Click

4. Mouse Wheel Scroll


To operate these mouse opertaion through gesture I have specifed specific gesture to each as described below:

1. Mouse Cursor Move: To move mouse cursor use your only right hand with all fingers closed/closed fist and then move your hand cursor will move.

2. Mouse Left Button Click: Use only right hand with close fist to point and use only left hand with index finger enabled(extended) and perform key tap gesture to perform left click.

3. Mouse Right Button Click: Use only right hand with close fist to point and use only left hand with two finger i.e. index and middle finger enabled(extended) and perform key tap gesture to perform right click.

4. Mouse Wheel Scroll: Use right hand with index finger enable(extend) and perform clockwise circular motion(gesture) to scroll down and to scroll up perform anti-clockwise circular motion(gesture).
